#Poker Hand 

##About
This project was completed by Katharine Chen and Mark Rubenstein for Week#3 of Epicodus (Ruby and TDD). 

##Description
The objective was to write a method that takes an array of cards, represented by letters and number, as an argument, and returns the poker hand the cards represent. For example, poker_hand(['2S', '3C', '4D', '5C', '6H']) would return 'straight'.

##Functionality 

```ruby
poker_hand(['2S', '3C', '4D', '5C', '6H']) ##return 'Straight'
```
